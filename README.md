# skeletal-data-fusion-for-human-Gait-Analysis
In the present work, we propose a skeletal data fusion system for human gait analysis. The proposed system is composed of two main parts, the first part which concerns the acquisition and processing of skeletal data acquired by a Kinect sensor network. 
A Client/Server architecture is used for the management and fusion of sensor data in order to obtain a single final skeleton, which will be used to reproduce real human movements by an Avatar in the virtual world. 
The second part concerns the exploitation of the merged data by applying a series of pre-processing on them to extract necessary parameters for the analysis and classification of human gait using a set of machine learning algorithms.
