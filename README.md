# skeletal-data-fusion-for-human-Gait-Analysis
We propose a skeletal data fusion system for human gait analysis which is a system composed of two main parts, the first part which concerns the acquisition and processing of skeletal data acquired by a Kinect sensor network. The second part concerns the exploitation of the merged data for the analysis of human gait using a set of ML algorithms.
